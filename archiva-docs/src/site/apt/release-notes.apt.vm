** New in Archiva 2.2.3

  Apache Archiva 2.2.3 is a bug fix release:

  * Some fixes for the REST API were added to detect requests from unknown origin

  * Some bugfixes were added

** Compatibility Changes

  * The REST services are now checking for the origin of the requests by analysing Origin
    and Referer header of the HTTP requests and adding an validation token to the Header.
    This prevents requests from malicious sites if they are open in the same browser. If you use
    the REST services from other clients you may change the behaviour with the new
    configuration properties for the redback security (<<<rest.csrffilter.*>>>, <<<rest.baseUrl>>>).
    For more information see {{{./adminguide/customising-security.html}Archiva Security Configuration}} and
    the {{{/redback/integration/rest.html}Redback REST documentation }}.

    <<Note:>> If your archiva installation is behind a reverse proxy or load balancer, it may be possible
     that the Archiva Web UI does not load after the upgrade. If this is the case you may access the WebUI
     via localhost or edit archiva.xml manually. In the "Redback Runtime Configuration" properties you have to
     enter the base URLs of your archiva installation to the <<<rest.baseUrl>>> field.

  * Archiva uses redback for authentication and authorization in version 2.6

History

  Archiva was started in November 2005, building a simple framework on top of some existing repository conversion
  tools within the Maven project. Initial development focused on repository conversion, error reporting, and indexing.
  From January 2006 a web application was started to visualise the information and to start incorporating
  functionality from the unmaintained maven-proxy project.

  Development continued through many stops and starts. Initial versions of Archiva were built from source by contributors,
  and the first alpha version was not released until April 2007. Some significant changes were made to improve
  performance and functionality in June 2007 and over the next 6 months and a series of alpha and beta releases, a concerted effort
  was made to release the 1.0 version.

  Archiva became an Apache "top level project" in March 2008.
