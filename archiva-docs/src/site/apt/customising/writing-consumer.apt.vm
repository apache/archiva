Writing a Consumer Plugin

 For a sample custom consumer, you can checkout the archiva-consumer-plugin at the archiva sandbox in the SVN repository:
 Prior to release 1.4, plexus components are not anymore supported, you must use Spring components.

+----+
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/archiva/sandbox/archiva-consumer-plugin
+----+

 Below are the steps on how to create a custom repository consumer and plug it in Archiva:

 [[1]] Create a project for your component.

 [[2]] Declare your class or in this case, consumer as a component as shown in the example below. This
   should be put at the class level.

+----+
Ex.
@Service("knownRepositoryContentConsumer#discover-new-artifact")
@Scope("prototype")

where,
  Service: unique id for your consumer.
  Scope: the creation strategy prototype or singleton.
+----+

 [[4]] Package your project by executing 'mvn clean package'

 [[5]] Let's say you are using the apache-archiva-${project.version}-bin.tar.gz to run Archiva. Unpack
   the binaries then go to bin/linux-x86-32/ (assuming you are running on Linux), then execute
   './run.sh console'. Then stop or shutdown Archiva after it started. (This is necessary to unpack
   the war file.)

 [[6]] Copy the jar file you created in step 4 in apache-archiva-${project.version}/apps/archiva/webapp/lib/

 [[7]] Add the necessary configurations in archiva.xml (in this case, add 'discover-new-artifact' as a
   <knownContentConsumer>)

 [[8]] Start up Archiva again.
