Apache Archiva Redback Runtime Configuration

%{toc}

* Apache Redback User Manager/RbacManager Implementations

  Since 1.4-M4, you can choose to switch dynamically

   * User Manager Implementations (from Database and/or LDAP).

   * RbacManager Implementations (from Database and/or LDAP): to manage if roles management comes from Database and/or LDAP.

* LDAP configuration

  LDAP configuration can now be done via an UI and it's now dynamic (no more need of using vi to edit a file :-) ) and no more need of restarting.

  You can test your ldap configuration too.

* LDAP Group-Roles mapping

  Since 1.4-M4, you can map dynamically LDAP Group to Archiva Roles

[../images/ldap-group-roles-mapping.png]

* Runtime properties

  You can now too modify some Redback configuration properties. You have a help button which explains to you what the property is doing.

* Users Cache

  You can enable/disable users cache and configure various ttl values
