Apache Archiva legacy repository support configuration

  Archiva supports both Maven 1 and Maven 2 clients transparently when used as a proxy. The
  underlying managed repository can use either the default or legacy layout, and Archiva will
  convert the requested path to the expected internal format.
  
  However, due to the lack of structure in maven 1 "legacy" artifact request format, 
  Archiva must split the request path to discover artifactId, version and 
  classifier - and this is not always deterministic.
  The strategy used by Archiva has been tested on many existing artifacts in the public central
  repository, but users may require support for private artifacts or for 
  artifacts with classifiers.
  
  Since version 1.0.1, Archiva provides a legacy support configuration to the administrator. It
  is possible to register some custom legacy path and the expected artifact 
  reference. Archiva will check that the entered artifact reference matches
  the legacy path, to avoid corrupted data in repository.

  For example:

    * Path: <<<jaxen/jars/jaxen-1.0-FCS-full.jar>>>
  
    * Group ID: <<<jaxen>>>
  
    * Artifact ID: <<<jaxen>>>
  
    * Version: <<<1.0-FCS>>>
  
    * Classifier: <<<full>>>
  
    * Type: <<<jar>>>

  This prevents the artifact incorrectly getting translated to a version of <<<1.0>>> and a classifier of <<<FCS-full>>>.
  
  Those custom legacy path are stored in the archiva.xml configuration file.
  By default, <<<jaxen-1.0-FCS-full>>> is registered, as it is used by some core
  Maven 1 plugins (however this is not the case if you upgraded from a previous
  version and retained your configuration file).
